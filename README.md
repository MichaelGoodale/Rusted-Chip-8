# Rusted-Chip-8
Yet another interpreter for Chip-8 written in Rust

This is a little project I put together over a weekend or two, which is an interpreter for the [Chip 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) language written in Rust. 
There's no unsafe blocks anywhere in my own code, and it seems to run most programs with little problem.
